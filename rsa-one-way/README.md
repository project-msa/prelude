# Introduction
an implementation of RSA encryption on one-way message transfer in a server-client model.

# Instructions
instructions on how to quickly get this working
1. start the server: 
`python3 server.py`
2. start the client:
`python3 client.py`

to exit, close the the `client.py` process first, and then the `server.py` process. in case of any abnormal terminations that result in `OSError: Address already in use`, kill the process by extracting the PID of the process.
